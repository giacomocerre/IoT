# IoT laboratory with WEMOS D1 Mini #

This repo contains some sketches that can be used to get a basic understanding of a how an
IoT sensor works, and a few slides to guide the activity.

Using and WEMOS D1 Mini the student proceeds from the basics of programming a SoC, to the publication of data in a dweet.io channel.

1. IoT_0: the bare blink
1. IoT_WiFi: scan all reachable WiFi AP
1. IoT_AP_ServerTCP: create a local AP with a TCP server
1. IoT_Join: join an AP (WPA only)
1. myPing: pinging an Intenet host (difficult)
1. IoT_dweet: feed data to the dweet IoT service using REST API
1. IoT_TS_MQTT: feed data to the ThingSpeak service using MQTT

To complete the activity each student needs to buy the WEMOS, that is found for less than 10 Euros in many online shops, and a computer with the Arduino IDE. No soldering required, just connect the WEMOS to USB port of the PC. An accessible AP or a tethering smartphone are required.

All documents are in Italian: if you are interested, please ask and I'll be happy to translate them
in english (or french).
